This is a basic code refactor project for a made up buisiness named Horiseon.
The website overall overs a presentable interface that informs about the 
wide benefits of increasing visibility through search engine optimization, and also mentions the importance 
of online reputation and social media marketing. 

Most of the website was entirely functional before any refactoring, except for one link due 
to a minor error. A large amount of the changes that I added were simply changing non-semantic 
elements to the best suited element for its application. As well many classes were only used in
one instance, which would be more appropriate as an id. In the other way around, there were id's 
used multiple times which I replaced with classes. 

These changes allowed me to condense the CSS file especially where the same style rules were 
being repeated several times accross the file.

Finally I added detailed comments explaining everything in the CSS step by step.
